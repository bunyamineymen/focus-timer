# Focus Timer

Focus Timer app helps users to stay focused and productive by using timed work intervals with short and long breaks. It
is based on the Pomodoro Technique. The app features session tracking with a local database, daily goals, achievement system, breathing exercises, multiple focus programs, theme customization, and detailed statistics with Canvas-based charts — all optimized for circular wearable displays.
